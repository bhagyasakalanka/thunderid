# Control Plane image.
#
# The Control Plane is where configuration is authored, versioned, and promoted between environments.
# It serves no runtime traffic; that is the Data Plane's (see Dockerfile.dp).
#
# The distribution layout, the scripts, and the databases are the product's own, so this builds them
# the same way the hybrid image does and swaps in the Control Plane binary, configuration, and
# console. The binary is installed under the name start.sh expects, so nothing downstream has to know
# which plane it is running.

# Pinned to the machine doing the building, not the machine the image is for. The Go build already
# cross compiles (see TARGETARCH below) and the frontend build is architecture independent, so
# building for another architecture costs a cross compile rather than emulating the whole toolchain.
