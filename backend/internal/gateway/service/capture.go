// gateway the control plane administers directly.
//

// one: they live in each data plane's own store. It goes to that gateway alone, because creating
// an application while developing must not reach into production and set the credential running
// there. The others receive theirs when one is set against them deliberately.
//
// It returns how many providers received the secret. Zero with no error means the organization has no
// gateway registered yet, which the caller treats as "nothing to do" rather than a failure:
// secrets created before a gateway exists are recreated on the next apply.
