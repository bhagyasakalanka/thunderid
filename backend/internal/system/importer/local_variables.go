// fillSecretPlaceholders supplies values for the credential placeholders the caller did not send,
// reading them from this deployment's own secret store.
//
// Secrets are the only thing this server fills in. Every other value belongs to whoever is applying
// the configuration and arrives in the request, so a placeholder with no value fails the import rather
// than being resolved from something on this host: silently taking a different value from here is how
// two deployments end up disagreeing about what was applied to them.
//
// A credential is different because it deliberately never travels with the configuration: it is set
// against this deployment and the configuration carries only a placeholder.
//
// How that placeholder is filled depends on the plane. A Data Plane receives configuration applied
// from a Control Plane, and the credential it refers to was pushed into this deployment's store
// beforehand: the placeholder is filled with the credential itself, so the resource is written through
// the ordinary API with a real value and is indistinguishable from one created here by hand. Hashing
// is left to that API, so nothing here needs to know which credentials are only ever verified.
//
// Anywhere else, including a hybrid server, the placeholder keeps the reference for a credential held
// as a hash, and only a readable one is substituted. A hybrid server is not applied to by a Control
// Plane, so nothing has put the credential in its store for this import to find, and rewriting its
// resources with values read from a local store would change what a plain import means.
//
// Values the caller did send always win, so an explicit request is never overridden.
